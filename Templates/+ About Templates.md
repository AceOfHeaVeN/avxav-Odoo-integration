To automate your templates we need to add the Templates folder to two locations:

 1. The core Obsidian Templates Plugin:
	 - Open Settings:
		 - Select "Templates" from the left hand menu.
			 - In the location Folder add the name of the templates folder.
			 - For me is is "5 Extras/Templates".
 2. The Templater community plugin:
	 - Open Settings:
		 - Scroll down the left hand menu, and under community plugins, locate and press on Templater.
			 - In the Template location folder, add the name of the templates folder:
			 - For me it is "5 Extras/Templates".
