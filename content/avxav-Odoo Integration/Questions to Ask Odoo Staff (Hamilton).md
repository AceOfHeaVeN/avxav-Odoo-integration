## Entire Company
### Can I link the documents app to my windows explorer?

So that I can create documents inside the Odoo documents app, and then be able to see them as windows files and folders?

And when I open one of the files, it opens it in Odoo Documents app.

### Can I modify Odoo Documents for example a spreadsheet in Microsoft Excel?

Adding up to the first question, will we be able to modify Odoo files using the tools we already use and love (Microsoft ?Office)?

All of the employees are already used to MS apps, and this might be the hardest change in all of the system.

### What is the best way to setup folder names (Folder Structures) for everyone in the company to be able to access the data that they need?

For example, I personally have the client name as the main folder, then inside there will be the particular project for this client, then the files.

However, I saw that the logistics have their folders by the year first then by client, and the files for the project.

Which is better? what are the best practices for folder structures?
