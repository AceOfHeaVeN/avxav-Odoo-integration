Agenda for Monday's Meeting:
### Regarding the Product template shared on Friday 14-Jun-24

- **Product Variants**: What is this field?
	- Is this variances like the size of the product or the color? Ex:
		- 9" Chocolate Fudge Cake
		- 8" Chocolate Fudge Cake
		- etc.
	- Or is this a variant for purchasing products. Ex:
		- Purchasing from a certain brand of cream cheese, but that brand is out of stock so,
		- We purchase from another brand, is this a variant?
- **Purchase UoM**:
	- How to define this on the system for each raw material?
		- We purchase some products in a pack of 12 or 24, but each product is unique, for example, many products can be purchased in 12 pcs, but for example:
			- Peanut butter are 340g per pcs.
			- While Nutella is 750g per pcs.
- **Product category**:
	- We require sub categories for almost all items, ex:
		- Cakes:
			- Tea Time Cakes.
			- Single Layered Cakes.
			- Three Layered Cakes.
		- Raw Materials:
			- Dry Ingredients.
			- Confectionery.
			- Frozen.
			- Dairy.
			- Drinks.
			- Poultry.
			- Fats and Oils.
			- Sweeteners, Flavorings, and Food Coloring.
			- Jam, Marmalade, and Fruit Fillings.
			- Nuts.
			- Fruits and Legumes.
			- Kraft and Disposable Items.
			- Kitchen Utensils.
			- Cleaning Supplies.
- **Locations**:
	- There are three location fields, Warehouses, Locations, Inventory Locations.
		- How are these different?


- We also need to add the **Waste Percentage** field, this might be one of the major reasons that cause us to have lots of variances when doing the inventory count.
- Finally, The **Expiry Date** for products is the most important field, and a must-have for all products.
