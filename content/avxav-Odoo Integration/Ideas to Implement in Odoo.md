### Streamline the Onboarding Process of new clients

The onboarding process can make or break how the client perceives us for the long run, and can affect their future interactions with us. So, we should make this process as effective as possible.

Here are some of the ideas that I have in mind:
- When winning a new project and submitting this into the system, a checklist should be created for how the onboarding will take place:
	- [ ] Send a confirmation email to the client that we accepted their order and will begin processing it.
	- [ ] Send them a welcome email.
	- [ ] Start creating drawings if any (Create a new Task for Zaid automatically).
	- [ ] Send them the drawings via email.
	- [ ] Get required 3rd party pricing if any (Create a task for Omar to get the prices).
	- [ ] Create sales quotation.
	- [ ] Follow up if no reply.
	- [ ] After Quotation is confirmed, create project plan (Create a new task for Omar **Bonus: [[avxav Problems (Odoo to Fix)#^3607c5|Project Plans]]**).
	- [ ] 


### Keep Important Documents (Legal Data of the company and of the employees) so that they can be accessed whenever needed

Examples:
- Selling to a new customer, they request the company's legal docs.
- Traveling to other countries, we need passports.
	- Each employee card could hold their legal documents that only HR, or certain managers can access, as well as the same employee.
	- IDs are also needed when working inside of governmental institutions.
