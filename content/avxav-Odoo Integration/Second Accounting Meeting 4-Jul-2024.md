### Data Migration

Basically, what we require is the history of transactions that matter for us, this includes:
- Aging for Inventory Items.
- AR and AP.
- Inventory Movement:
	- When a product was ordered,
	- When was it delivered to the client,
- Any open balances, even if they were 5 years or older.

We don't require the closed balances that have been finished.
