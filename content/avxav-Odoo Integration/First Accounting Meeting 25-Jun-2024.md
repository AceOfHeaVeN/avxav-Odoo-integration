MOMs:

Today's meeting with Hamilton's Diala (Project Manager) and Abdallah Al Lala (CFO) was very interesting and fast-paced.

The meeting basically went as follows:
- The CFO Started by asking us questions related to the processes that the Accounting and Finance do on a daily bases.
	- This quickly escalated into very deep examples of those processes, and how Odoo could help us implement these complex processes.
	- Many of the features that we discussed needed customization, and were not supported by the Standard Odoo app.
- Phase 1 of the project included information gathering for Finance, Accounting, Supply Chain, and Sales.
	- In this meeting we discussed the first three, and sales will be done at a later time.
- The First topic that we discussed in this meeting was the warehouses and inventory tracking.
	- We gave them heaps of examples of how the process usually goes, and details of the complexity of it.
		- Some cases were things like

Finance Questions:
- We are using the same systems for Inventory and accounting.
- Warehouses:
	- A very important feature that we require is the shelf management.
	- Everything can be done inside of Odoo itself.
		- Emails, Documents, etc.
