## What are cross trades (Cross Bookings)?

A **cross trade** is a shipment organized between two countries – none of which the seller is locally based in. They’re also known as **_foreign-to-foreign shipments_**, **_third party shipments_** or – more commonly – **_triangle shipments_**.

Think about it this way: you’re selling a product to someone in Japan, but your product is manufactured in China. A cross trade transaction involves shipping your product directly from China to Japan.

It’s called a ‘triangle shipment’ because there are three countries involved in the transaction – the country of origin, the destination, and your business in Australia.

Cross trading has become very popular as more and more Australian businesses enter into international markets.

Personally to me, it looks similar to Drop Shipping, where you in *Country A* sell someone from *Country B* from a supplier in *Country C*.

## Why would I use a cross trade?

There are many reasons businesses use cross trades – all of which can end up saving you money in the long-term. Here’s why exporters should use cross trades when selling their product overseas:

- **Accessing new markets** – cross trades are a great way to break into a new market without having the extra expense of on-selling your product from your local country once it’s already been imported.
- **Lower supply chain costs** – the supply chain is one area where so many costs can be streamlined. Cross trades completely remove the need to bring goods into the seller’s country, which means removing _freight costs_, _duty costs_ and _taxes_ associated with initially importing the product.
- **Less transit time –** why export to your seller’s country if it’s halfway across the world? Cross trade shipments can reduce transit times, meaning greater cost savings for your business (imagine the time that can be saved by shipping from China to Japan, rather than from China to Australia and then on to Japan).
- **Efficiency in the supply chain –** Cross trades bring production and stock closer to the final destination, as the whole supply chain becomes decentralized.
- **Using a local forwarder** – Rather than trying to find someone overseas to manage a cross trade for you, you can deal with your local forwarder in your own time zone, who will manage the complexities of each country for you whilst you keep one local contact.
