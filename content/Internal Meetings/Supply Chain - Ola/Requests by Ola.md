### Requests:

- PO Handling for Terms and Conditions (T&C):
	- When creating a new PO for a new vendor, we can simply choose one of the existing templates for the T&C that we can attach easily, then be able to edit as needed.
	- Then, the next time we create a PO for the same vendor, it should automatically use the last used T&C, and we can edit if needed.
	- Lastly, the size of the T&C shouldn't be limited to 1 page, as we usually extend it to more than 1.
