## 26-Jun-2024 - General Information With Ola

In this meeting, we talked about Incoterms:

![[SC - INCOTERMS (International Commercial Terms)]]

We discussed this issue:
![[avxav Problems (Odoo to Fix)#^9f64ce]]

We discussed the concept of ![[SC - Cross Booking]]

### Requests:

- PO Handling for Terms and Conditions (T&C): ^PO-Handling
	- When creating a new PO for a new vendor, we can simply choose one of the existing templates for the T&C that we can attach easily, then be able to edit as needed.
	- Then, the next time we create a PO for the same vendor, it should automatically use the last used T&C, and we can edit if needed.
	- Lastly, the size of the T&C shouldn't be limited to 1 page, as we usually extend it to more than 1.
